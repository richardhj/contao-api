# contao-api

This is my personal playground for a prototypical Contao API.

In the beginning, it aims to provide a Content API, so Contao exposes its articles, navigation modules etc. to be used in static site generator. I became a big fan of Gridsome lately ;-)

My personal motivation is to contribute to a Contao API that is part of the Contao core. This will make it possible to use Contao as a headless CMS one day ðŸš€

This project uses Symfony API platform. But that's only because of rapid prototyping.
